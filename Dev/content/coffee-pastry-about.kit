        One Shot proudly serves Stumptown Coffee.  We get their hand-crafted, direct trade coffee 
        shipped directly from the Red Hook, Brooklyn roastery each and every week. Using Hairbender 
        Espresso, we offer a rotating specials menu of carefully refined espresso drinks every week 
        in addition to our classic cafe drinks menu. For sipping or giving, we offer our Stumptown Coffee
         custom-made One Shot House Blend on drip and in retail bags.  Additionally, we feature 
         small-batch coffee roasters such as Rival Bros and Argo Coffee as retail take-home bags.
          All of our baristas undergo detailed training, both at the shop and at Stumptown headquarters 
          in Red Hook Brooklyn.

        In addition to our coffee program, we offer a variety of Intelligentisa and Tea Source teas, 
        served hot or iced.
