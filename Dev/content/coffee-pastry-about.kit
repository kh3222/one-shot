                One Shot proudly serves Stumptown Coffee.  We get their hand-crafted, direct trade coffee 
                shipped directly from the Red Hook, Brooklyn roastery each and every week. Using Hairbender 
                Espresso, we offer a rotating specials menu of carefully refined espresso drinks every week 
                in addition to our classic cafe drinks menu. For sipping or giving, we offer our Stumptown Coffee
                custom-made One Shot House Blend on drip and in retail bags.  Additionally, we feature 
                small-batch coffee roasters such as Rival Bros and Argo Coffee as retail take-home bags.
                All of our baristas undergo detailed training, both at the shop and at Stumptown headquarters 
                in Red Hook Brooklyn.

                In addition to our coffee program, we offer a variety of Intelligentisa and Tea Source teas, 
                served hot or iced.

        At One Shot, we think that the next best thing to coffee 
        is pastry. Virtually all of our pastry is made in house 
        including our famous and made-fresh-every-day Fresh Fruit Scones, 
        Rustic Tarts, and the much talked about Baby Kronuts. Our selection 
        of pastry changes every day, and we are always trying something new 
        out so stop by often to see what was just baked.
