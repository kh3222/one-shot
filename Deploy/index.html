                        At One Shot, we think that the next best thing to coffee 
                        is pastry. Virtually all of our pastry is made in house 
                        including our famous and made-fresh-every-day Fresh Fruit Scones, 
                        Rustic Tarts, and the much talked about Baby Kronuts. Our selection 
                        of pastry changes every day, and we are always trying something new 
                        out so stop by often to see what was just baked.
